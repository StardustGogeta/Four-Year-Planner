# Four-Year-Planner

A work-in-progress tool for creating a four-year plan with ease.

This program works using React.JS. In order to run it, download this repository and the latest version of Node.JS, run `npm install` in this directory,
and then run `node server.js`. Finally, go to `localhost:3000` to see the application running. (This is necessary to prevent CORS errors with the JSX when run locally.)
